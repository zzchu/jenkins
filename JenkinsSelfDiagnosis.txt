Jenkins Self Diagnosis

General troubleshooting:
•	Once there is unexpected failure or sifirst step is to check failed/problematic build's console output and search for error, failed, .etc. Error messages usually will be printed out at the bottom of console output
•	Sometimes, we may find some unusual jenkins system exceptions, especially remote connection exception. In this case, please first check slave node log, like https://wme-jenkins.cisco.com:8443/computer/IMAC-SJC/log to make sure connection between slave and master is normal
•	Don't abort wme-jenkins, it may cause windows file being locked 
•	junit timeout exception may caused by machine time difference or jenkins processing delay


Job sepecific troubleshooting
1.	WME-GIT-CONFIG
•	Code confliction is one of the common causes. Best practise is "Always keep local working copy updated and merge with wme git master before pushing"
•	For Windows, if there are git exception in console output, check whether there are other related process running, like msbuild, which may cause filed being locked

2.	WME-GIT-UT
Check console output and find out whether it is build error or case failed first
test reports will be uploaded as artifacts
Usually, UT job failure will not relate to device, but if there is no clue at all, check device connection

3.	WME-GIT-IntegrationTest
Check console output and find out whether it is build error or case failed first
Device log and generated app will be uploaded as artifacts
Usually, if any cases are skipped, the cause may be device connection lost
fast check if there are failed/skipped case:
On windows
 •	check adb connection of 2 android devices, "adb devices"; if there is device missing, force kill adb process may help to revolve the issue
 •	check internet connection of connected devices
On mac
 •	check ios device connection with ios-deploy, "ios-deploy -c"
 •	check internet connection of connected devices
 •	Check camera status
